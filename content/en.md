# Hello and welcome on my website!

My name is **Orane Marchal**, I live in Paris (France) and I am an *Optical Engineer*. After working in Public Research on optical diagnostics for plasma characterization, I studied *Non Destructive Testing* using ultrasounds. I am now working in the automotive industry as an *Optical Design Engineer* for front lighting using LEDs. Please check the “Resume” section for further details.

Apart from optics I love music, sports, TV shows and visiting the numerous great museums Paris has to offer.

I hope you will enjoy your visit!
